# ThrusterLights
A small arduino program to add flame light effects to the rocket bed of my son.
The hardware used for this is 3 NeoPixel Jewels and an AdaFruit Pro Trinket 5V/16MHz.

### Uploading the firmware
Select the Pro Trinket 5V/16MHz (FTDI) as the board.
Select USBTiny as bootloader
You may need to press the button on the board to enter bootloader mode.

### NeoPixel Jewel connection
The thrusters are each controller by their own pin (pin 4, 5, and 6 respectively).
